# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal).

## Algorithm:
1.Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

3.Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

4.Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points Motivation Submission:

5.Mention the GitHub Repo URL in the submission text and attach the lab report pdf.

## Output:

~~~
Here are two different UX project scenarios, each walking through:

1. Problem Statements 
2. Research Methods 
3. Personas

Scenario 1: Designing a Government Service Portal for 
Citizens (e.g., Tax Filing Portal)

1. Problem Statements 
● Problem Statement 1: 
"Middle-aged citizens with limited digital literacy need a way to file their taxes online 
without confusion or technical jargon because the current government portal is overly 
complex and not user-friendly, which results in missed deadlines, errors, and 
dependency on third parties."

● Problem Statement 2: 
"Freelancers and gig workers need a way to track and submit their income and tax 
obligations easily because the system does not support flexible income structures 
well, which results in inaccurate filings and a frustrating experience." 
2. Research Methods 
● In-depth Interviews 
To understand challenges faced by diverse user groups, especially those with limited 
tech knowledge or irregular income. 
Justification: Helps uncover specific frustrations and mental models when navigating 
complex systems. 
● Usability Testing 
On the current government portal to observe real-time friction and navigation issues. 
Justification: Ideal for identifying usability problems and areas of confusion in the 
interface. 
● Surveys 
To gather quantitative data on user satisfaction, usage patterns, and top challenges. 
Justification: Useful for prioritizing feature improvements based on widespread 
needs.

Scenario 2: Designing a Health & Wellness Mobile App

1. Problem Statements

fitness and mental wellness routine because they struggle to balance work, fitness, 
and self-care, which results in burnout and lack of long-term engagement."

● Problem Statement 2: 
"New users to fitness need a way to track progress and get personalized guidance 
because generic workout plans don’t fit their needs or limitations, which results in low 
motivation and high dropout rates." 
2. Research Methods 
● Diary Studies 
Track user behavior, mood, and app interaction over 2–3 weeks. 
Justification: Helps understand the sustainability of habits and where drop-offs occur. 
● User Interviews 
With fitness beginners and busy professionals to understand motivation and barriers. 
Justification: Offers detailed context around what users need to stay consistent. 
● A/B Testing
